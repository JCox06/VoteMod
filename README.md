# <u> VoteMod (A3.1)</u>
How many times have you had it? You have a Minecraft server and ask your newly 
invited friend to join too. You tell them the IP, they log in, and-- oh, yeah the Whitelist.
The Admin is offline, so you can't ask them.  
VoteMod fixes this issue by allowing standard players to vote on certain things. Read more
below.

####<u> What does VoteMod do? </u>
Standard small grouped survival Multiplayer servers in Minecraft face many problems
with regard to server administration (well they have from my own experience) this is because
the servers consist of a group of friends, where only a select few of players are given 
server administrator.

The problem comes when server administrators leave the server, at this point anyone can do
what they like because of the lack of administration.


VoteMod is a plugin for Spigot Minecraft Servers that aims to remove these issues. This is
done through a voting-like system. This mechanic allows standard players to take
administrative actions on a server.

These actions can be: ban, unban, mute, and unmute. 

#### <u>Disclaimer and info</u>
This is a small project that I hope to work on. I'm going to be honest, although the plugin
works I'm not too confident on the quality of my code, in fact not at all!

I genuinely struggled on certain bits of the project, and in fact after completing it
I really need to practise some multi threading in Java.

I also feel as though I would like to add some sort of dependancy
injection at some point.

BUT!!!! if you notice, anything at all that could be improved, please let me know.
I want this project along with my experience to improve too! Thanks.
